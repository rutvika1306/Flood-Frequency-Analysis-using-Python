# Flood-Frequency-Analysis-using-Python
Python-based implementation of flood frequency analysis using statistical probability distributions to estimate return periods and peak discharges.

This project utilizes Python to implement flood frequency analysis for hydrological data.  
It estimates the magnitude of extreme flood events corresponding to various return periods, helping in flood risk assessment and hydraulic structure design.

### Features
- Reads and processes annual maximum discharge data.
- Fits multiple probability distributions (e.g., Gumbel, Log-Pearson Type III).
- Estimates design floods for user-defined return periods.
- Generates frequency curves and comparison plots.
- Includes statistical goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov).

### Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Spyder IDE (Anaconda Distribution)

### Applications
- Flood risk mapping
- Dam spillway design
- Urban drainage planning
